SHAPES: CALIFORNIA ENVIROSCAN DATA BY TRACT
......................................................

==> DATA SHORTLINK: http://bit.ly/mapping-workshop

California Tracts: http://bit.ly/ca-tracts 
California EnviroScreen Data: http://bit.ly/ca-enviro

Shapes + Data
Married (or merged) on the census's GEOID code for each tract

Upload data to Google Fusion Tables

    CSV from mapping-workshop bundle: CalEnviroScreenOct2014.csv
    
    (The Excel file is also in the bundle. This is a CSV for the first sheet only)

    Upload the CSV to Google Fusion Tables
    http://drive.google.com
    -> Create
    -> Fusion Table
    -> Chose File
    -> Navigate to CalEnviroScreenOct2014.csv (may be in your Download folder)
    -> Next
    -> Next
    -> Finish
    
    -> PRE-COOKED! I've already uploaded this for you at: http://bit.ly/ca-enviro
    -> I then made it public using the "Share" button
    
OK! Now we need the tract SHAPES.
    - Can get from census: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2014/main
    - But WAIT!
    
    Quick digression about SHP vs KML
        - Difference between the two
        - Can convert one to the other using 
            cartodb.com (upload as SHP in a zip file, Export as KML)
            shpescape.com (slower, but drops it right into Fusion Table)

    I've given you a converted file as california_tracts_simplified.kml
        - You can upload it, like you did the CSV (Fusion tables accept KML files)
        - BUT WAIT! I've already done that
        - I uploaded it and then made it public using "Share"
        - Open a new tab and view it at http://bit.ly/ca-tracts 
        - Click on "Map of Geometry" tab
        
Let's put them together!

    - Go to the Enviro Data table
    - File -> Merge
    - Go to the Tract map
    - Copy the full URL of the tract map
    - Go back to the Enviro Data
    - Paste that URL into the thin box at the bottom
    - Next
    - Need to tell Fusion Tables what data columns should be matched
        use the "Cenusus Tract" column from the enviro table
        use the "geoid" column from the tract table
    - Next
    - Merge
    - Click on the link for the new table
    - See the merged data!
    - Go to "Map of Geometry" tab
    - Don't freak out if you see dots instead of shapes or missing shapes ... just zoom in a level or two
    
Make it pretty (and interesting)

    - "Map of Geometry" -> Change map
    - New column on the left side (may have already been open)
    - Feature Map -> Change feature styles...
    - Polygons -> Fill Color -> Buckets
    - Divide into 5 buckets
    - Column: "Athsma Pctl"
    - Click: Use this range
    
    - Go back to try the gradient
    - Feature Map -> Change feature styles...
      (I like to make the opacities 100% to demo)
     
    - Add a legend
    - Feature Map -> Change feature styles... -> Legend -> Automatic legend
    
    - Fix the info window
    
    - Share it!
        Share -> Make it public
        ALSO:
        "Map of Geometry" -> Publish ...
            Gives you
                link
                embed code
                html & javascript

POINTS IN POLYGONS: PRE-K FACILITIES IN NYC
......................................................

==> DATA SHORTLINK: http://jkef.me/mapping-workshop
==> FILES USED: prek_sites_seats_demo.csv, nynta.zip

    Challenge: Determine Pre-K availability, by NYC neighborhood

    Upload List of Pre-K spots
        - We'll be using prek_sites_seats_demo.csv
        
        - First we geocoded all of the addresses to get lat/lons
            Can do on Google, if you're making a Google Map
            I like http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/
            Also http://batchgeo.com/
            Cartodb.com also has a service
        
        - Log into cartodb.com
        - Drag/drop file onto dashboard to upload
            
        Note that CartoDB detects a lat-lon column and makes points!
            If it doesn't, use the "Georeference" option ...
            Can also do addresses, for a fee
    
    Upload Neighborhood
        - This is the nynta.zip file
        - It's NYC neighbhorhoods, and they're made up of census tracts
        
        - Got this from NYC.gov:
            http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/applbyte.shtml#other
            
        - Note: This data (and almost all nyc data) is NOT in latitude & longitude
        - It's in another projection called the New York - Long Island State Plane Coordinate System (feet)
        - CartoDB fixes that on upload
        - Upload by dragging nynta.zip to your carto.db dashboard

        Change color if you want
        
    Share it
        "Visualize" button
        Give it a name
        Now the "Share" button
        Can share the public URL or the embed URL
        Can embed on a site with the Embed code (tho will cost once it goes over limit)
        
        Back to the table view:
        * Rename the column "seats"
        * Can Download
    
    We took the extra step to compare these numbers census data to estimate how many 4-year-olds were in each neighborhood. The 2010 decennial census has single-age breakdowns all the way to block level. We used the tract-level data for the number of 1-year-olds in 2010 to determine the number of 5 year old

TILED MAPS: GREEN TAXI PICKUPS IN NYC
......................................................

==> DATA SHORTLINK: http://jkef.me/mapping-workshop
==> FILES USED: green_taxis.zip (be sure to unzip it!)

- Download Tilemill from http://mapbox.com/tilemill
- Launch Tilemill
- Pick "New Project"
- Give it a name (no spaces) like green_taxis
- Give it a title, like Green Taxi Pickups
- Leave everything else as-is

Now we see a map. Quick tour.

- Get yourself zoomed in to the NYC area
- Note that it's a "rough sketch" of the countries
- Click the stack of papers/layers in the lower left
- Choose "add layer"

We're adding a file

- give it a short ID, like "pickups"
- leave Class blank
- on the Datasource line, click the "Browse" button and go find your green_taxis.shp file from the zipped file
- click done
- leave the other fields as-is
- click "Save & Style" (the middle button)

OK! Now to styling!

Let's make the borders of the markers disappear. We don't need 'em for clairty.

- add `marker-line-width: 0;` to "pickups" and  hit "Save"

We can't see how many dots are stacked up on each other. Let's try making them half-transparent

- add `marker-opacity: 0.5;` to pickups and hit save.

Getting better! But let's try even more transparent:

- add `marker-opacity: 0.08;` to pickups and hit save.

Let's save our "bounding box" (it'll save us hassle later)

- click on the wrench in the upper right
- zoom in to the data (go down to zoom level 10 for now)
- shift-click-drag a box across the data
- click the center of the box to drop a "center" pin (will have a label like Z10)
- change the "zoom" bar on the right to go from 2 to 16 (dragging each end)
- add a name at the top if you wish
- hit save

First, let's get rid of the countries. We could just delete those lines, but in case we need them, let's "comment them out" -- which turns them into notes instead of code.

Do that by putting a /* at the start of the section and a */ to end it. So like this:

	/*
	#countries {
	  ::outline {
	    line-color: #85c5d3;
	    line-width: 2;
	    line-join: round;
	  }
	  polygon-fill: #fff;
	}
	*/

- click save

OK, let's play with the colors!

- change the background color to #666
- change the marker-fill color to #a5f706

Cool!

Finally, let's mek the marker width a little smaller:

- change to marker-width:3;


Now, you can upload this to Mapbox.
You'll need a free Mapbox account
Go to http://mapbox.com

- Back in Tilemill, first we want to comment-out the background (so we upload only the data layer)

	/*
	Map {
	  background-color: #666;
	}
	*/

- click save
- now use the "Export button"
- Choose "upload"
- Sign in
- ignore the early time estimates (like 6 days!)

Back on the mapbox site, click Projects and make a new project

- create project
- zoom into new york
- play with the colors of the land, streets and areas
- add the data layer by using Data -> (stack icon) -> Add Layers
- get embed code by using Project button
